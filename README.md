# 3d kenken

TODO:
- build the puzzle
    - need directionality to work regardless of camera angle
    - minimum k-coloring (it's random right now)
        - construct the graph
        - solve for the colors and make sure each color is mapped to a cage
    - make the thing pretty (balance colors, figure out edges)
    - explode the cages for easy access
    - check for valid solution on final submission
- generate a 3D KenKen from scratch
    - determine unique solution (for completeness)

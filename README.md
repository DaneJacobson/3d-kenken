# 3d kenken

TODO:
- full operations (only addition right now)
- add correct operation processing to evaluatePuzzle()
- point and click on boxes
- explode the cages for easy access
- ship somewhere online (maybe Vercel?)
- need directionality to work regardless of camera angle
- make the thing pretty (balance colors, figure out edges)
- determine unique solution (for completeness)
- balance out the operations/cage sizes
- add a key so people know the controls lol
- timer

Speedups
- 6x6x6 takes too long to generate, need to figure out why and optimize generation algorithms
- Wiping colors is tough, I think it might be necessary to add cubes to the cageInfo for quick retrieval
